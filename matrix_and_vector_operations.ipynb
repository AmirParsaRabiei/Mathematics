    "\n",
    "1. `np.matmul(A, Ainv)`:\n",
    "   - `np.matmul()` is a NumPy function that performs matrix multiplication between two arrays.\n",
    "   - It multiplies the matrices `A` and `Ainv` following the rules of matrix multiplication.\n",
    "   - The resulting matrix will have dimensions compatible with the input matrices.\n",
    "   - In this case, since `A` and `Ainv` are both 2x2 matrices, the result will be a 2x2 matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you're dealing with arrays (or matrices) instead of single vectors, the dot product concept is extended to matrix multiplication. For 2D arrays, the dot product is the matrix product of the arrays. For two matrices `A` and `B` to be multiplied, the number of columns in `A` must be equal to the number of rows in `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example with 2D arrays:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

    "product = np.dot(A, B)\n",
    "print(\"Matrix Product:\\n\", product)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For 3D arrays, the dot product is a bit more complex. It involves summing products over certain axes. In NumPy, `np.dot()` will perform a sum product over the last axis of the first array and the second-to-last of the second array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example with 3D arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define two 3D arrays\n",
    "A = np.random.randint(10, size=(2, 3, 4))\n",

    "print(\"Dot Product of 3D arrays:\\n\", product)\n",
    "print(\"Shape of the result:\", product.shape)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this 3D example, the result will be a 4D array because `np.dot()` combines the arrays in a way that the last axis of `A` and the second-to-last axis of `B` are summed over, and the remaining dimensions are expanded outwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the dot product in the context of arrays is essentially matrix multiplication, and the rules for matrix dimensions apply. The dot product of vectors is a special case of matrix multiplication where each vector is treated as a matrix with one row or one column."

    "Certainly! Let's create a more detailed example to illustrate the difference between `np.matmul()` and `np.dot()` when dealing with 3-D arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `A` is a stack of two 3x4 matrices, and `B` is a stack of two 4x3 matrices. When we use `np.matmul(A, B)`, it performs two separate matrix multiplications: one for each pair of matrices in the stack. The result is a new stack of two 3x3 matrices, so the shape of the result is `(2, 3, 3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we use `np.dot(A, B)`, it combines the matrices in a different way. It performs a sum product over the last axis of `A` (size 4) and the second-to-last axis of `B` (size 4), resulting in a 4-D array. The shape of the result is `(2, 3, 2, 3)`, which can be a bit unintuitive. It's as if for each `i` and `j` in the first two dimensions, you're taking the dot product of `A[i, :, :]` with `B[j, :, :]`.\n",

    "**Sum of vectors (vector addition)** can be performed by adding the corresponding components of the vectors: if $v=\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "          v_1 & v_2 & \\ldots & v_n \n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}^T\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ and  \n",

    "          v_1 + w_1 & v_2 + w_2 & \\ldots & v_n + w_n \n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}^T\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$. The so-called **parallelogram law** gives the rule for vector addition. For two vectors $u$ and $v$ represented by the adjacent sides (both in magnitude and direction) of a parallelogram drawn from a point, the vector sum $u+v$ is is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram drawn from the same point:\n",
